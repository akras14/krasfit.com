In the past 5 months I was able to go from 218 lbs to 191 lbs (a 27 lbs loss and counting). I am still 6 lbs above my target weight, but I was able to lower my cholesterol to healthy range without taking any medication.

Here is before/after picture for my cholesterol tests taken in late November 2018 and again in April 2019. **All high indicators reverted back to healthy range.**

The weight loss diet that worked? Simple **Calories In - Calories Out** method.

I created this blog to help spread the word. Weight loss market is flooded with various products, but nothing comes close to ease and effectiveness of calorie counting.

## Five Step Program to Free and Effective Weight Loss

### Step 1. Take a photo of yourself every two weeks

I took the "before" photo at the top of this page before I knew HOW I was going to lose weight. I knew I had to lose weight and decided to start taking photos of myself in the least favorable position possible, to motivate myself to get better.

Dieting was pretty hard at first and photos motivated me. They also helped me to keep track of my progress without relying on the scale results alone, which fluctuated up and down and moved in jumps at random time intervals.

### Step 2. Use Smart Phone App to Count All Calories Consumed

I prefer the app called [LoseIt](https://www.loseit.com/), but there are others, like MyFitnessPal. Anything would work, as long as it has a good database of products and makes it really easy to log food/calories consumed.

[LoseIt](https://www.loseit.com/) database is really good. Chances are anything with a bar code is already in their database, so all you have to do is scan it. It also has a lot of meals from popular restaurants. Home made meals are easy to estimate by entering ingredients or finding similar items.

### Step 3. Use Exercise to Make Diet Tolerable

Diet is 80% of the work, exercise is only 20%. That being said exercise is a must. As a bonus, it makes calorie counting much more tolerable.

LoseIt has an area to enter exercise for the day. Calories burned during exercising, cancel out some of the food that I eat. I exercise most days, just so I can eat more.

Funny thing is that my hunger mostly seems to be affected by calories consumed, and not net (consumed - burned) calories for the day. I feel full on days where I ran 7 miles, but ate a lot, even though my caloric intake is negative. On other days I feel hungry, even if I sat on my butt all day.

For the purpose of weight loss, any exercise will do. It may be better to run, but walking for 30 minutes here and there also works. The important part is to be consistent and keep as active throughout the day/week as possible. I can work on becoming Mr. Olympia after my weight is back to normal.

### Step 4. Work with Others

I was bless to have a few friends and family members join me on this adventure. It helped me to stay motivated and engaged. It's much more fun to follow any program with other people. If nobody wants to join you, I would recommend asking somebody to be your accountably partner to check-in on your progress every one or two weeks.

### Step 5. Use Knowledged Gained to Maintain Healthy Weight

I have not got to this step yet. That being said, this experience allowed me to develop an intuition for how my body works. I am going to use this knowledge for the rest of my life.
