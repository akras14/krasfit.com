I've been trying to find a weight loss program or diet that works for about 13 years.

In 2006 I separated from the military and my weight quickly ballooned to 235lbs. This began my long struggle to try to lose weight. A few times I was able to get it back down to about 205lbs.

In the past 12 weeks (3 months) I was able to go from 218lbs to 200lbs, as presented in the before/after picture bellow.

The weight loss diet the worked? **Simple calorie counting**.

**TLDR:** I used an app called [LoseIt](https://www.loseit.com/) to estimate my calorie intake and to set a weight loss goal of 1.5 lbs per week.

## Back story

As I mentioned before, I was in the military and was in a really good shape through out my time there. Towards the end of my service, I got an idea that I was too skinny, so I decided to train myself to over consume calories to "bulk up". It was an idiotic idea, but I was able to get away with it as long as I was still in the military. As soon as I got out, my weight ballooned to 235lbs.

My wife and I went fishing shortly after and she took a picture of me sitting down without my shirt one. I've realized how fat I got, freaked out and worked my ass off for the next few months to get my weight back down to about 205 lbs. I was able to keep this weight for a while, mainly through going out for long runs a few times a week.

I've developed pain in my left knee during my time in the military. I saw treatment for it, and was advice to greatly reduce the amount of running that I did. I stopped running and began my struggle to keep my weight under control.

Over the years I've tried many things to keep my weight under control: body for life challenge, south beach diet, paleo diet and CrossFit, the primal blueprint and eating vegan. They all seemed to worked at first, but it was pretty hard to keep track of and benchmark my progress. It kind of all felt like magic, and I wasn't sure why and how it was or was not working.

## High Cholesterol Scare

My wife and I have two little children and I have a history of heart disease in my family. My father died when he was only 45 (I am 36). His dead has died in his mid fifties, shortly before I was born and I never got to meet him.

My cholesterol has spike in the past, and I was able to bring it down with diet and exercise. I was supposed to get it tested every year, but with little children I "forgot" to do it for a few years. I finally got it tested a bit over 3 months ago, and it was really high. We-are-going-to-have-to-put-you-on-meds high. My doctor recommended me to get some other blood to further confirm if I was at risk for heart disease, and this test also showed me as high risk. This really freaked me out.

## Falling into an Approach that Works

I decided to get serious about losing weight. I've browsed a weight loss group on reddit.com and found a story of some person who was able to lose over 100lbs in a year, simply by calorie counting and doing light forms of exercise.

Next day, I ran into a friend of mine, who told me that he began calorie counting using an app called [LoseIt](https://www.loseit.com/). I've used this app in the past, but he told me that it became much more user friendly.

I've downloaded the app and have been using it since. It is very user friendly. They have a large database of products, most things with a bar code already there. Most meals form big name restaurants are already there. Even many home made meals can be quickly looked up. Worse case, I fall back onto entering ingredients one by one, but even then I only have to do it one, and I can loop up my past meals and re-use them.

I found the first two weeks to be the hardest. My daily budget is about 2000 calories. I believe i used to consume double of that. So first few weeks was a big shock to my system. I've set my initial goal to lose one pound a week. Once I got used to it, I increased my goal to 1.5 pounds per week and kept it at that since.

## Key Takeaways

### Math Works

The math is simple. If you consume less calories than your body burns, your body will be force to burn fat causing a weight loss. People commonly call it Calories In/Calories Out (CICO) online.

Number of calory deficiency needed to lose a pound of fat will vary depending on the source. The highest number I saw was 7000 calories deficit per pound of fat. Even with number that high, it's easy to lose a pound every two weeks (with 500 calorie deficit per day). This means that worse case a person can lose 26 pounds a year, a very significant number. In my experience, my daily deficit was a bit higher than 500 calories, and I was able to lose close to 1.5 pound per week.

### Trust the Process, Don't Check the Scale

I would weight myself almost every day in the first few weeks of the diet. This was a bad idea. It was really hard to adjust to my reduced calorie count as it is. Seeing my weight fluctuate up and down was demoralizing and made me question myself. I decided to only check my weight only once every two weeks or so. Two weeks seems to be enough break to have my weight always trend down, and keep me motivated.

### Healthy Food is Good for Calorie Counting

One of the best things about calorie counting is that it encourages me to eat healthy. Since I was not only trying to lose weight but also lower my cholesterol I tried to eat a heart healthy diet. I cut out most trans fats (red meat, egg yolk, dairy, reduce oil etc). I tried to eat as vegan as possible, but I would still eat chicken or fish 5 to 7 times a week.

I used to hate healthy foods. Eating out without getting meat was a waste of money for me. Now I love soups and salads and whole wheat bread. The return on caloric investment is amazing. I feel full with much fewer calories and I love it.

### Exercise is Good for Calorie Counting

I always knew exercise was important, but I was too lazy to do it. Turns out hunger is a GREAT motivator for exercise. I have not been so consistent with my work outs since my military days.

LoseIt let's you enter your work outs. Calories burned are subtracted from the calories consumed. This means that a light half hour walk let's me eat an extra snack between my meals. Five mile run buys me a really large meal of my choice. The funny thing is I am still losing weight. I've noticed that my brain is tricked into feeling like I've had a large meal, even if I burned more calories than I've just consumed shortly prior.

Working out is the best thing to make calorie counting as enjoyable as possible.

### Skip the Breakfast, Drink Some Coffee

This may not be a great advice, but it works for me. I've noticed that it's fairly easy for me to skip breakfast, especially if I've worked out in the morning and/or had some coffee. That buys me 300-500 calories extra to contribute to my other meals. I try to eat a lighter dinner as well, with most of my caloric intake taking place during lunch and light snacking before dinner.

### Low Calory/ Long Lasting Snacks

As I mentioned,first few weeks were really hard for me, but at the same time I was determine to take my weight loss seriously. One of the things that I found really helpful was [Werther's Hard Candy](https://amzn.to/2BOmEFa). I choice it because it had only natural ingredients, it was very low calory, long lasting and it did not use sugar substitutes. Seems like having a small amount of real sugar, tricked my brain into not feeling as hungry.

Fruits, vegetables, berries, toast with low sugar spread, and low calorie bars are also great snacks. Sparkling water with a hint of flavor can also go a long way.

Last but not least, staying hydrated helps to trick brain into feeling full and decreasing the feeling of hunger.

### Invest in a FitBit

About a month into my weight loss I invested into a [FitBit Versa](https://amzn.to/2ErSIAu) and wsa pretty happy with it. It's certainly not a must have. LoseIt (free version) or something similar is the only must have in my opinion. That being said, I found FitBit to be a good companion to LoseIt in my journey.

My favorite features are more accurate calorie burn estimation, sleep tracking, hourly reminders to move, and vibrate (no ring) alarm/timer/call notification.

### Invest in a Food Scale

LoseIt makes it really easy to estimate colories consumed, but I found it pretty hard to estimate portion size at time. A simple [food scale](https://amzn.to/2VhmKwA) solves this issue. Having a food scale at home, even helps me when I am not at home. I only need to measure a certain type of food once, to be able to better estimate portion size next time I run into the similar type of food.

## No Guessing, No Magic

I love calorie counting. It's by far the best diet I've tried in my life. It answered so many questions, that I didn't fully understand before.

Why did I not get fat in the military? Because I burned so many calories in a day, that it literally did not matter what I ate. Most people in normal conditions do not burn nearly that many calories unless they are training for a marathon or are engaging in some other high impact activity.

Why did other diets worked at first? Probably because I was motivated and at first, and learn to cheat later on. Even a vegan diet can be very high calorie with chips, nuts and french fries.

Calorie counting is very black and white. I know the amount of calories I put into my body. I know the amount of calories I burn. My future weight and my health is entirely up to me.
