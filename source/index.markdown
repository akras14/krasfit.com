In the past 5 months I was able to go from 218 lbs to 194 lbs (a 24 lbs loss), as presented in the before/after picture bellow.

As of writing, I am still 9 lbs above my target weight. I was, however, able to get my cholesterol completely under control purely through diet and exercise, without taking any medication. Lowering cholesterol was the main motivator for my lifestyle change.

Here is before/after picture for my cholesterol tests taken in late November 2018 and again in April 2019. All high indicators reverted back to healthy range.

The weight loss diet that worked? Simple **calorie counting** also known as Calories In - Calories Out method.

**TLDR: I used an app called [LoseIt](https://www.loseit.com/) to track my calorie intake to lose about 1.5 lbs per week.**

I created this blog to help spread the word. Weight loss market is flooded with various products and noise level is extremely high. I've tried a number of solutions over the years, and nothing comes close to the effectiveness of calorie counting.

## Five Step Program to Free and Effective Weight Loss

### Step 1. Take a photo of yourself every two weeks

The photos at the top of this page are not staged. Before I knew how I was going to lose weight, I decided to start taking photos of myself in the least favorable position possible. I knew from other experience that whatever gets tracked, gets done. Before I could make any positive changes I needed to get honest with myself.

Dieting was pretty hard at first, and photos also helped to serve as inspiration to show me that my hard work was paying of. Going forward, as I get into the maintenance mode, I am hoping that continuous photo taking will help me stay accountable, and prevent my weight from ballooning out of the hand again.

### Step 2. Use Smart Phone App to Count All Calories Consumed

I personally prefer the app called [LoseIt](https://www.loseit.com/). Other people prefer different apps, such as MyFitnessPal. In either case,as long as the app has a good database of products and makes it effortlessly to estimate calorie intake, the app would do just fine.

I find LoseIt database to be so good, that it is able to find 99% of all things that I am trying to enter via bar code. It also has a lot of meals from popular restaurants entered already. All other meals are really easy to estimate by either entering ingredients, or finding a similar food item.

### Step 3. Use Exercise to Make your Diet Easier

Diet is 80% of the work, and exercise is only 20%. That being said exercise goes a long way in helping make calorie counting more pleasant and easier to tolerate.

Lose it has an area where I get to enter all my exercise for the day. The calories burned during exercising, get added to my daily calorie budget. I make sure to exercise most days, just so I can eat more.

Of course, better exercise is better for weight loss. Running and weight lifting is better than walking. That being said, walking is a form of exercise and it helps weight loss a lot.

I found that calorie counting and resulting hunger has been the best motivator for exercise, and I've worked out 5 days a week on average, since I started the diet.

### Step 4. Spread the Word and Diet with Others

When I saw the diet really work for me, I began to spread the word to other people. In addition to helping others, it helped me to continue to stay motivated and engaged. It's much more fun to follow any program, if other people in your life are following it as well.

### Step 5. Use Knowledged Gained to Maintain Healthy Weight

I have not got to that step yet, as I mentioned earlier, I still have 9 more lbs to go. That being said, as a result of Calorie Counting, I've developed an intuition of how various foods affect me. I am hoping that this knowledge will help me to maintain healthy weight for the long term.
